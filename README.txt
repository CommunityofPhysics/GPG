** How to set up a Python environment **

  1. Install the latest version of Python (with the appropiate architecture) from the official website.
  2. During installation, make sure to tick the checkbox that says 'Add Python to Path'
  3. After installation is complete, open a command-line with admin priviledges and type the following
            python -m pip install --upgrade pip
  4. Pip will then update itself. After it is complete, install numpy using the command
            python -m pip install numpy
  5. Now you're ready to run the python files in the repository. Open the IDLE editor which comes
     pre-installed with Python, open the script and run it from the menu.
     
  6. If Python shows an error mentioning that it can't find pip, then type the following command first
            python -m ensurepip
     before trying step 3 again.
  7. If anything goes wrong during the steps 3-4, and you can't use pip anymore, then go to Settings
     and repair Python from there.
